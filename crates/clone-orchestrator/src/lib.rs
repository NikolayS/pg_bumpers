//! Clone-orchestrator for pg_bumpers — the **dry-run blast-radius engine**
//! (SPEC §4, §10.1, §12).
//!
//! Rehearses a proposed write (on a DBLab clone if present, else in a
//! rolled-back txn — the baseline `clone.provider: none`, §12), measures the
//! blast radius into the §10.1 [`pgb_core::BlastRadius`] record, and guards apply
//! with a PK-set checksum so row-identity drift is caught even when the row
//! *count* is unchanged (SPEC §4, §10.2).
//!
//! # The flow
//!
//! 1. [`propose`] a candidate statement → a [`Proposal`] (stable id + TTL,
//!    measured against the injected [`pgb_core::Clock`], §10.4).
//! 2. [`dry_run`] the proposal against a [`Rehearsal`] backend: it refuses
//!    volatile/non-deterministic predicates and PK-less targets **before
//!    executing**, otherwise runs the statement in a `BEGIN … ROLLBACK` txn,
//!    measures (affected-PK set + cascades + triggers + locks + WAL + duration +
//!    LSN/staleness), and folds the facts into a [`pgb_core::BlastRadius`] — then
//!    rolls back so **nothing is persisted**.
//!
//! # Refusals (fail-closed)
//!
//! - Volatile predicate → REFUSED, never executed (SPEC §4) — the WHERE clause is
//!   AST-walked; non-deterministic special keywords (`now()`/`CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`
//!   /…) are refused by name and every other function is resolved against
//!   `pg_proc.provolatile` (volatile/unknown ⇒ refuse, fail-closed). See
//!   [`predicate`].
//! - No primary key → REFUSED, **no `ctid` fallback** (SPEC §10.2; identity is
//!   keyed on the PK only today — `REPLICA IDENTITY` is orthogonal — see
//!   [`dry_run::DryRunError::PkLess`]).
//! - Non-certified shape (DDL/`TRUNCATE`/`INSERT`/…) → REFUSED (default-deny,
//!   §10.3).
//!
//! # Guarded apply (S3, [`apply`])
//!
//! [`guarded_apply`] is the **reversible half of the moat**: once a proposal has
//! passed the dry-run, it applies the write on the primary under the §4 guards —
//! PITR fence (when enabled; else the typed-inverse is the undo, §1) → `BEGIN` +
//! `statement_timeout ≈ 3× dry-run` → [`pgb_core::ApplyBarrier`] seam → apply with
//! `RETURNING` (capturing the target + cascade pre-images + the actual written-PK
//! set) → **full-blast-radius apply-time PK-set re-check** (the target AND every
//! cascade relation, 0-tolerance drift abort) → **symmetric `pg_stat_xact_*`
//! full-effect reconciliation** (abort on ANY write to a relation outside the
//! dry-run's measured footprint, or ANY relation changing MORE than predicted —
//! this catches a post-snapshot trigger that `DELETE`s an out-of-predicate row or
//! wipes a separate table, and unguarded cascade drift, both invisible to
//! `RETURNING`) → **`RETURNING` written-set check** (same-relation identity drift)
//! → **full reversible pre-image capture** (target + cascades; abort if any change
//! cannot be captured as a reversible pre-image) → `COMMIT`, returning the captured
//! **typed-inverse** for the revert (#37). This is the "0 catastrophic data-loss FN
//! by construction" mechanism: a drifted/irreversible write can no longer commit.
//! Anything outside the closed certified action set is refused and never applied.
//! [`guard_decision`] below is the low-level drift-decision primitive the engine's
//! PK-set check builds on.
